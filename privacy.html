            Last updated: June 8 ,2017
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Varsquid ('Varsquid', 'us', 'our' or 'we') has adopted this privacy policy ('Privacy Policy') to explain how Varsquid collects, stores, and
            uses the information collected in connection with Varsquid's products, services, and websites (together 'Services').
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Should you have any questions relating to this Privacy Policy, please contact us at varsquid@gmail.com.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Varsquid reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at reasonable times, so please review it frequently. Your
            continued use of Services will signify your acceptance of the changes to this Privacy Policy.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            1. Non-personal Data <br/>
            For purposes of this Privacy Policy, 'non-personal data' means information that does not directly identify you.
            Additionally, non-personal data means 'aggregate' and 'de-personalized' information, which is data Varsquid collects about
            the use of Varsquid Services, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Varsquid may use tools to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable Varsquid to identify you.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            2. Personal Data <br/>
            For purposes of this Privacy Policy, 'personal data' means personally
            identifiable information that specifically identifies you as an individual.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Likely situations when you make personal data available to Varsquid include, but are not limited to:
            (i) requesting technical support;
            and (ii) otherwise through use of Varsquid Services where personal data is required for use and/or participation.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The types of personal data may vary depending on the type of activity you are engaged in.
            The personal data Varsquid may collect, process and use may include, but are not limited to your email address.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Varsquid may use personal and non-personal data, both individually and combined together,
            for purposes of analyzing usage of the Services, providing customer and technical support,
            managing and providing Services, and to further develop the Services and other Varsquid services and products.
            Varsquid may combine non-personal data with personal data.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            3. Location Data <br/>
            We do not use or collect your precise geographic location.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            4. Data Retention <br/>
            Varsquid retains the data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes
            outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
            Thereafter if the collected data is no longer needed for purposes specified in this Privacy Policy,
            Varsquid deletes all aforementioned data in its possession within a reasonable timeframe.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Irrespective of the above, Varsquid may still retain some of the data to the extent such retention is necessary to
            resolve disputes, enforce Varsquid user agreements, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints
            related to the security, integrity, and operation of Services.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where we do business.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            5. Safeguards <br/>
            Varsquid follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure
            the security, integrity, and privacy of the information in Varsquid's possession.
            Data collected by Varsquid is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public.
            To prevent unauthorized on-line access to data, Varsquid maintains data behind a firewall-protected server.
            However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            6. Third Parties <br/>
            Varsquid uses third-party ad networks to monetize the Services.
            Ad networks are companies that manage the advertising process on this and many other apps.
            For that reason, they may know information about you based on the way you use all the apps where they provide
            advertising services. They compile this information to paint a picture of
            which types of adverts you are likely to be interested in.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You can find out more about how they use your personal information here: <br/>

            <br/>
            <br/>
            7. Other <br/>
            If you are under 13 years of age or a minor in your country of residence, please ask your
            legal guardian's permission to use or access the Services. Varsquid encourages parents and/or guardians to play an
            active role in their children's online experience at all times. Varsquid does not knowingly contact or collect information
            from children under 13. If you believe Varsquid has inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so
            Varsquid can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.
